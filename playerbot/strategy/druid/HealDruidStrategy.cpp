/*
* The healing druid has the following main rotation
*  (DONE) - use 'tree of life' initially on fight
*  (DONE) - use 'rejuvenation' when the anyone including you has lost any hp
*  (DONE) [MAYBE 2 MUCH IN RAID?, TANK IS ENOUGH]- use 'rejuvenation' when the fight has started on as much party players as possible (no need to know their dmg) [no aura]
*  (DONE) - use 'wild growth' whenever any party member has lost any hp (can be started on fight start till end) [almost full]
*  (DONE) - use 'regrowth' when no regrowth buff is applied and you or anyone hast lost any spell
*  (DONE) - use 'regrowth', when nourish is not working and heal + restart hot
*  (DONE) - use 'nourish', when hp has been lost "a bit more than almost full" AND an auro of type lifebloom, rejuvenation, regrowth or wild growth is active
*  (DONE) - use 'barkskin' when on medium hp
*  (TODO) - use 'barkskin' when a huge thread cast like 'tranquily' is about to be used
*  (DONE) - use 'swiftmend' when someon is at low hp
*  (DONE) - use 'healing touch' ONLY, when it can be casted instantly and someone is at least at medium health
*  (DONE) - use 'tranquility' only, when whole party (group or raid) is at low hp
*  (DONE) - use 'nature's swiftness' when someone is at critical health combined with 'healing touch'
*  (TODO) - use 'lifebloom', when 'cleacasting' is available, and noone is lower than medium health (regain mana later)
*  (TODO) - use 'lifebloom' on maintank on big encounters and stack it to 3 (+ holding it when it is nearly about to end) OR get mana back and end
*  (DONE) - use 'innervate' when on low mana
*  (TODO) - use 'innervate' when someone else by importance is at low mana (main healer?)
*  (DONE) - use 'rebirth' when someone died in battle (maybe bad to have this automatically - let human decide this??)
*  (TODO) - use 'rebirth' when someone of importance died in battle (tank, main healer) (maybe human player?)
